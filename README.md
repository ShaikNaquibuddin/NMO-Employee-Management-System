The project title “NOM EMPLOYEE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM” is an attempt to computerize Employees record to make the processes like: Adding a new employee, managing the data base, payment of salary on the bases of designation, experience ,overtime, bonuses, etc. 
This project was developed using Java Programming and Microsoft Access as the backend that gives us a friendly environment. The transaction like log in, add, search, delete are provided. The Employee payroll software stores the details like Employee Name, Address, Pin Number, Mobile No., etc.
 We can also view the Database in the main window and see tables where the data is actually stored and we can also maintain a table to see all the details of the employees in a single table.
